# sxyugao's dotfiles

These are the basic dotfiles that I start with when I set up a new environment.

To save more time, I write this for my Arch Linux.

Before all, please make sure that you have already installed a display manager.

## Usage

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sxyugao/dotfiles.git .dotfiles
cd .dotfiles
./Install.sh
```
